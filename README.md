# rbx-tools
A random collection of tools that I use within my Roblox games.
Some are intended to be run on the command line, others are useful module scripts for what I do.

I don't expect people to use these, they're literally just open sourced to make sharing them easier, and why not?
These are predominately Lua files. You may also be interested in [Polaris](https://github.com/neztore/polaris) or [rbx-export](https://github.com/neztore/rbx-export).
